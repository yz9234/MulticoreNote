	\section{Wait Free Consensus Hierachy}
	
	Consensus number of a shared object is the maximum number of processes that can use that object to solve consensus problem.
	
	Operation:
	R/W Register: Consensus number 1;\\
	TestAndSet: Consensus number 2;\\
	GetAndIncrement: Consensus number 2;\\
	Swap: Consensus number 2;\\
	CAS: Consensus number infinity;\\
	\subsection{Read-Modify-Write Objects}
	An Read-Modify-Write Object has the following structure:
	\begin{center}
		\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
		private int value; 
		public int synchronized getAndModify(int x) {
		int prev = value;
		value = f(value, x);
		return prev;
		}
		\end{lstlisting}
	\end{center}
	
	Function f sets a new value and returns the old value:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Test\&Set: f(value, x) = 1;
		\item Swap:  f(value, x) = x;
		\item Get\&Increment: f(value, x) = value+1;
	\end{itemize}
	
	An read-and-modify object can be characterized by function f:\\
	(1) RMW is commute if: fi fj = fj fi (for any i, j), where fi is the function applied by process i;\\
	(2) RMW is overwrite if: fi(fj(x)) = fi(x) (for any i, j);
	
	Theorem:\\
	Any \textbf{non-trivial} (f is not identity, if f is idenity, f is read operation f(value, x) = value, which has consensus number 1) RMW object with either commuting or overwriting property has consensus number equals to two.
	
	Proof(consensus number is at least 2):\\
	Use non-triviality: Value init to null. P0 and P1 store their proposals to an int[2] array.  There exists value such that f(value)!=value. Then call RMW, if return initial value then choose my value; else choose the other value;
	
	Proof(consensus number is at most 2):\\
	There is no protocol that solves consensus for 3 processes using RMW object. Any protocol has to reach some critical state:
	
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{upload.png}
	\end{center}
	
	From critical state, A does RMW(fi) reach 0-valent then B does RMW(fj); for another path, B does RMW(fj) reach 1-valent then A does RMW(fj). Because RMW has commute property, these two path has same state, then C can run. For C, the initial state is same, so, C will always reach same consensus and it cannot decide on different things. However, for the first path, C should reach 0-valent and for the second path, C should reach 1-valent, which contradict with uni-valent property.
	
	
	\subsection{2-Write-1-Read-Object ((2, 1) Object)}
	2-Write-1-Read-Object: Write on two locations atomically, read any one location.\\
	Protocol to solve consensus using (2, 1) object:\\
	
	int[3] (initial with null);\\
	Write proposal on int[3] array;\\
	P0 writes (a, a) in location 0 and 1;\\
	P1 writes (b, b) in location 1 and 2;\\
	Whichever writes first wins.
	
	Possible configurations during the process:\\
	\{a, a, null\}, (P0 won at this point);\\
	\{a, b, b\}, (P0 won);\\
	\{null, b, b\}, (P1 won);\\
	\{a, a, b\} (P1 won);\\
	
	This can solve consensus on 2 processes.
	
	\section{Universal Construction}
	Given some objects of consensus number m, construct an object with consensus number less than or equal to M.\\
	\textbf{Deterministic Objects:} state + operation cause a deterministic state.\\
	Universal Construction only applies to deterministic state.\\
	Correct Way: use a LinkedList, see code in github
	Initail state(Tail) -\textgreater apply method1 -\textgreater apply method2 -\textgreater apply method3(head) \\
	Each time invoking a method, add a node in the linkedlist as the new head.
	
	\section{Hashing}
	
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{hashing.png}
	\end{center}
	
	Linear Probing: insert in the next empty slot. May cause clustering effect and damage performance. \\
	Quadratic Probing: Try h(i) -\textgreater h(i)+1 -\textgreater h(i)+2^2 -\textgreater h(i)+3^2 -\textgreater h(i)+4^2 \\
